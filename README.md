### 🌍 20 Years Building Communities & Localizing Software

I've spent two decades doing what I love: making technology accessible to Italian-speaking communities and building authentic spaces where people connect. From founding Italy's first official Feeder fan community (with artist management partnership!) to leading Italian localization for Vivaldi Browser since 2018, I specialize in bridging cultures through technology.

**🎯 What I Do:**
- 🌐 **Italian Localization Lead** for 20+ open-source projects
- 👥 **Community Management** for gaming, music & tech platforms  
- 🎮 **Gaming Culture Expert** (retro gaming historian, Discord client localization)
- 🎵 **Music Industry Experience** (20 years artist community management)
- 🐧 **Linux Ecosystem Contributor** (Sailfish OS beta tester & community lead)
